### **Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Backtesting**

---

### **Introduction**
This notebook aims to explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict cryptocurrency price movements and evaluate the profitability of a trading strategy based on these predictions. Specifically, the focus is on leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s historical data to develop and backtest a model-driven trading framework.

---

### **Problem Statement**
Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, presenting both challenges and opportunities for traders. The goal is to predict Bitcoin's next-day price movement (up or down) using machine learning models and to test the profitability of a trading strategy driven by these predictions.

### **Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, normalize prices, and split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create lagged features from past prices.
   - Compute technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages.
   - Extract volume metrics like On-Balance Volume (OBV).

3. **Model Development:**
   - Train a baseline model (Logistic Regression) to predict price movement.
   - Use models like Random Forest or XGBoost for better predictions.

4. **Backtesting:**
   - Implement a trading strategy:
     - Buy if the model predicts "up."
     - Sell or hold if the model predicts "down."
   - Evaluate the strategy using metrics like cumulative returns, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Compare model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
   - Compare strategy profitability to a benchmark like a buy-and-hold strategy.

### **Models and Evaluation Metrics**

#### **Models to Use**
- Logistic Regression for baseline classification.
- Random Forest or XGBoost for advanced predictions.

#### **Evaluation Metrics**
- **For Model Performance:**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
- **For Trading Strategy:**
  - Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return).
  - Cumulative Returns (overall profitability).
  - Maximum Drawdown (largest portfolio loss from peak to trough).
