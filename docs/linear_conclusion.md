### **Conclusion: Why Logistic Regression Fails**

#### **Why Logistic Regression Fails**

1. **Linear Assumptions:**

   - Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the target. However, financial data, especially cryptocurrency prices, are influenced by highly non-linear patterns, making it difficult for logistic regression to capture complex dependencies.

2. **Imbalanced Predictions:**

   - Despite the dataset not being severely imbalanced, the model predicts only the majority class (class `0`, price decreases), leading to precision and recall for class `1` (price increases) being `0.0`.
   - Even with `class_weight='balanced'`, logistic regression struggles to correctly classify the minority class due to the overlapping and noisy nature of financial data.

3. **Feature Non-Linearity:**

   - Indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are non-linear in nature. Logistic regression cannot exploit the interactions and non-linearities between these features, further limiting its performance.

4. **Inherent Noise in Financial Data:**
   - Financial markets, particularly cryptocurrency, exhibit random movements influenced by external events, making it challenging for simple models like logistic regression to provide meaningful predictions.

#### **Why Move to a Different Model**

1. **Tree-Based Models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting):**

   - These models can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
   - They are robust to noisy data and can better capture patterns in financial indicators.

2. **Ensemble Methods:**

   - Combining predictions from multiple decision trees (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) can improve accuracy and balance the performance across both classes.

3. **Neural Networks:**

   - Neural networks, especially with recurrent layers (e.g., LSTMs), are better suited for time-series data as they can learn sequential dependencies.

4. **SMOTE with Complex Models:**
   - Advanced models can better utilize oversampled data created by SMOTE to address the imbalance issue without overfitting.

### **Conclusion**

Logistic regression is too simplistic for predicting financial price movements, especially in the volatile and non-linear cryptocurrency domain. We recommend moving to tree-based models or ensemble methods, which are better equipped to handle the complexity, noise, and non-linearities in the data. These models will likely improve performance and provide a more balanced prediction across both classes.
